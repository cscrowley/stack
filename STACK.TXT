The evidence supporting the claim that January 6th was a coup revolves around a coordinated effort by high-level political, military, and civilian officials—particularly within the Pentagon—to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power. Here’s an outline of the most compelling points from "Proof of Coup: How the Pentagon Shaped An Insurrection" by Seth Abramson, along with broader context from investigations and public records.

1. The Role of Pentagon Leadership
Chain of Command Manipulation: Key Pentagon figures, such as Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, and other civilian officials like Kash Patel and Ezra Cohen-Watnick, were installed after Trump lost the 2020 election. These appointments were part of a post-election "purge" that placed Trump loyalists in top positions across key agencies, including the Pentagon.
Charles Flynn's Role: Charles Flynn, the brother of Michael Flynn (a prominent figure calling for martial law to overturn the 2020 election), played a pivotal role in the Pentagon's decision to delay deployment of the National Guard. Despite initial denials that he was involved, evidence later showed that he was directly involved in discussions to withhold the Guard from the Capitol during the attack​.
Deliberate Delays of National Guard: On January 6, as the Capitol was under attack, urgent calls for help from the Capitol Police and the DC National Guard were met with delays. Charles Flynn and Walter Piatt, Director of the Army Staff, reportedly objected to sending the Guard, citing "optics"—an argument that drew widespread criticism as it contributed to the hours-long delay in reinforcement​.
Destruction of Evidence: In the months following January 6, the Pentagon "wiped" text messages and electronic records from top officials involved in the events of that day, including those of Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, Kash Patel, and other senior leaders. These deletions occurred after records requests had been filed, making it a violation of both the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act​.
2. Intentional Sabotage of the Peaceful Transfer of Power
Military-Style Planning: Trump allies, including Michael Flynn, advocated for using the military to seize voting machines and declare martial law. This idea was discussed in a high-profile Oval Office meeting on December 18, 2020. While the plan was publicly dismissed as too extreme, Trump's subsequent actions—like his refusal to authorize the National Guard on January 6—reflected some elements of this scheme​.
The "War Room" at Trump International Hotel: Trump allies, including Rudy Giuliani, Steve Bannon, and John Eastman, set up a "command center" at the Willard Hotel, not far from the White House. They operated in conjunction with Trump officials, discussing how to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's victory in Congress on January 6. Key figures in this effort were linked to Trump's Pentagon loyalists and right-wing extremist groups​.
Ongoing Coup Plot from December 2020 to January 6, 2021: The insurrection was not an isolated event but the culmination of a weeks-long conspiracy to overturn the election. The December 21, 2020 White House meeting between Trump and GOP lawmakers focused on efforts to block certification. Trump’s allies pursued multiple pathways, including pressuring Vice President Pence, filing false election lawsuits, and attempting to use fake slates of electors from swing states​.
3. Cover-Up and Obstruction of Investigations
Destruction of Key Communications: Text messages from the Pentagon, the Secret Service, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were deleted despite pending FOIA requests and congressional subpoenas. The deleted texts included messages from top Trump loyalists like Chad Wolf (DHS) and Ken Cuccinelli (Acting DHS Deputy Secretary), as well as Secret Service agents close to Trump on January 6​.
False Testimony and Lies Under Oath: Whistleblower Colonel Earl Matthews, a senior National Guard official, submitted a 36-page letter to Congress alleging that Pentagon officials, including Charles Flynn and Walter Piatt, lied about their role on January 6. Christopher Miller also gave false testimony about Trump’s orders regarding the National Guard, claiming Trump had given the order for 10,000 troops to be deployed—an assertion unbacked by any contemporaneous evidence​.
Unlawful Tenure of Pentagon Inspector General: Sean O'Donnell, the acting Pentagon Inspector General who oversaw the investigation of the Pentagon’s role in January 6, was found by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to have been serving unlawfully for nearly a year and a half. This raises questions about the legitimacy of his investigation and the suppression of evidence regarding Pentagon misconduct​.
4. The Role of Trump’s Close Associates
Michael Flynn's Call for Martial Law: Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn advocated for Trump to declare martial law, seize voting machines, and rerun the election. Sidney Powell (a pro-Trump lawyer) and Patrick Byrne (former CEO of Overstock.com) supported these efforts. Mike Lindell (MyPillow CEO) distributed documents at the White House calling for similar action just days before January 6​.
Ginni Thomas and John McEntee's Role in Purging Federal Agencies: Ginni Thomas (wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas) and John McEntee (Trump's former body man turned director of the Presidential Personnel Office) orchestrated a "purge" of career officials in multiple agencies, including the Pentagon. Their goal was to install loyalists who would support Trump's "Stop the Steal" agenda​.
5. Why This Was a Coup
Definition of a Coup: A coup d'état is the illegal seizure of power from a government. While most coups involve military forces overthrowing the government, in this case, Trump attempted to remain in power despite losing a democratic election.
Civilian Control of the Military: Trump’s post-election "purge" of the Pentagon and his appointment of ultra-loyalists in civilian leadership positions gave him indirect control over the military. The coup strategy relied on disrupting Congress's certification of the election results long enough for alternative electors to be recognized or for Congress to be pressured into rejecting the results​.
Orchestrated Chaos on January 6: The January 6 attack was designed to create chaos, delay the certification of electoral votes, and give Trump’s legal team time to advance its theory of "alternate electors." By blocking National Guard reinforcements and allowing the violence to escalate, Pentagon officials facilitated the intended delay of the joint session of Congress​.
6. Conclusion
The January 6th insurrection was not a spontaneous protest but the result of an orchestrated effort by Trump, his allies, and high-level officials within the Pentagon. The goal was to delay the certification of Biden’s victory, give state legislatures time to submit alternate electors, and ultimately pressure Vice President Pence to overturn the election. The direct involvement of civilian Pentagon officials, the deliberate obstruction of investigations, and the destruction of communications evidence make it clear this was not negligence or coincidence but a coordinated coup attempt.

The book "Proof of Coup: How the Pentagon Shaped An Insurrection" lays out this evidence in exhaustive detail, documenting the roles of key figures like Michael Flynn, Charles Flynn, Christopher Miller, Kash Patel, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, Ginni Thomas, and Donald Trump himself. The culmination of these efforts was not merely a violent attack on the Capitol but a broader plan to upend American democracy and unlawfully retain power.
